            <h2>Understanding Image Optimization and Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                This week, I learned that choosing the right image format is essential for web performance.
                The textbook explains that photographs work best as JPEG files because they support millions
                of colors, while logos or simple graphics with flat colors should be saved as GIF or PNG files because
                they support transparency and lossless compression. I was surprised to learn that we should avoid using
                spaces or punctuation in file names and always use lowercase letters to ensure the links work correctly
                on all servers.
            </p>

            <!-- Part 2: One image inside <figure> with <figcaption>. Informative → descriptive alt text. File in images/ folder. -->
            <figure>
                <img src="images/desktop-and-laptop-on-desk.jpg"
                    alt="A desktop computer and laptop on a desk" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption>Figure 1: Desktop and laptop on a desk — an example of a JPEG photograph optimized for the web.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                I also discovered that the number one reason visitors leave a website is because the page takes too long
                to download. Therefore, we must optimize images to reduce file size without losing quality. Furthermore,
                accessibility is critical. We must always include the alt attribute in our image tags. This provides a
                text description for visitors who use screen readers, ensuring that our website is inclusive for
                everyone, including those with vision challenges.
            </p>

            <img class="content-image" src="images/workspace-with-coffee.jpg"
                alt="A workspace with a laptop displaying code and a cup of coffee" loading="lazy">

            <!-- Part 2: Decorative image → alt="" so screen readers skip it. File in images/ folder, proper naming. -->
            <img class="decorative-image" src="images/simple-flower-as-a-drawing.png" alt="" role="presentation" loading="lazy">
