        <p class="intro">
            This week, I learned that Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to separate the style from the structure of
            a web page. This is very important because it allows us to control the typography and layout without making
            the HTML code messy. I was surprised to learn that by using an external style sheet, we can change the
            design of multiple pages just by editing a single text file. This makes maintaining a website much easier
            than before.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also found the topic of colors very interesting. I learned that computer monitors display color using a
            combination of red, green, and blue light, which we call RGB. To use specific colors in our code, we use
            Hexadecimal values that start with a hashtag, like #FFFFFF for white or #000000 for black. The professor
            emphasized that we must always check for sufficient contrast between the text and background so that our
            content is accessible to everyone.

        <h2>The Three Types of CSS Styles:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inline Styles:</strong> These are coded directly into the body of the web page using the style
                attribute, but they only apply to that specific element.</li>
            <li><strong>Embedded Styles:</strong> These are placed in the head section using the &lt;style&gt; tag and
                apply to the whole document.</li>
            <li><strong>External Styles:</strong> This is the most useful type because it saves the rules in a separate
                file with a .css extension.</li>
        </ul>
